#What is TomEE?

Apache TomEE, pronounced "Tommy", is an all-Apache Java EE Web Profile certified stack where Apache Tomcat is top dog.
Apache TomEE is assembled from a vanilla Apache Tomcat zip file.
We start with Apache Tomcat, add our jars and zip up the rest. The result is Tomcat with added EE features - TomEE.

Apache TomEE comes with four different flavors, Web Profile, JAX-RS, Plus and Plume.

* Apache TomEE Web Profile delivers Servlets, JSP, JSF, JTA, JPA, CDI, Bean Validation and EJB Lite.
* Apache TomEE JAX-RS (RESTfull Services) delivers the Web Profile plus JAX-RS (RESTfull Services).
* Apache TomEE Plus delivers all that is in the Web Profile and JAX-RS (RESTfull Services), plus EJB Full, Java EE Connector Architecture, JMS (Java Message Service) and JAX-WS (Web Services).
* Apache TomEE Plume delivers all that is in the Plus Profile, but includes Mojarra and EclipseLink support.

All Dockerfile files of supported versions can be found at https://github.com/tomitribe/docker-tomee

# How to use this image.

Run the default TomEE server (`CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]`):

    docker run -it --rm tomee:<java-version>\-<tomeeversion>\-<flavour>

For example:

    docker run -it --rm tomee:8-jre-7.0.3-webprofile

You can test it by visiting `http://container-ip:8080` in a browser or, if you
need access outside the host, on port 8888:

    docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8080 tomee:8-jre-7.0.3-webprofile

You can then go to `http://localhost:8888` or `http://host-ip:8888` in a
browser.

The configuration files are available in `/usr/local/tomee/conf/`.  By default,
no user is included in the "manager-gui" role required to operate the
"/manager/html" web application.   If you wish to use this app, you must define
such a user in `tomcat-users.xml`.

You can also use this image as base image in your Dockerfile file. 
Then you can add your application by running next Dockerfile operation:

    ADD <locationofapplication>/<warfile> /usr/local/tomee/webapps/<warfile>
